Utility for downloading and uploading test data to an Infusionsoft database

This is deliberately simple, supporting only upload, download and delete. It has no dependencies except on standard Python libraries. It has been tested with Python 2.7. 

Use as

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`python <path to i2csv.py>  <parameters>`
  
For a description of usage and parameters:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`python <path to i2csv.py> -h`

There is a short suite of tests in test.py; these require an Infusionsoft account with some data and user-defined fields set up - see the file test.py for details.

Enjoy!
